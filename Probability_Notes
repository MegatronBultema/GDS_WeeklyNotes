Random Variable
  an outcome
  within a specified sample space
  value is determined by a PDF
  X - values it can take
  x - value it actually took
  P(X=x)

Permutations - order matters
Combinations - order doesn't matter
always more permutations than combinations






Probability Notes

Cumulative distribution functions
  a function whose value is the probability that a corresponding continuous random variable has a value less than or equal to the argument of the function.

Probability mass function - discrete random variable
  In probability theory and statistics, a probability mass function (pmf) is a function that gives the probability that a discrete random variable is exactly equal to some value.

Probability density functions
  a function of a continuous random variable, whose integral across an interval gives the probability that the value of the variable lies within the same interval.
  PDF is associated with continuous rather than discrete random variables; the values of the PDF are not probabilities as such: a pdf must be integrated over an interval to yield a probability.

Expected value
  In more concrete terms, the expectation is what you would expect the outcome of an experiment to be on average. The expected value (or mean) of X, where X is a discrete random variable, is a weighted average of the possible values that X can take, each value being weighted according to the probability of that event occurring. So the expected value is the sum of: [(each of the possible outcomes) × (the probability of the outcome occurring)].

Variance
  The variance of a random variable tells us something about the spread of the possible values of the variable. For a discrete random variable X, the variance of X is written as Var(X).
    Var(X) = E[ (X – m)2 ]

Standard Deviation
  The standard deviation of X is the square root of Var(X).
