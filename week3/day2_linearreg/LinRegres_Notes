categorical - beware of interpreation of variables

indicators for every state or every school
test scores across schools
don't use categorical variables

multilevel modeling ... have to use pymc
random effects modeling


anova - generalized linear model..?

MAE - the mean of the absolute value of the errors
MSE - the mean of the squared errors

MAE is the average error and MSE accounts for larger errors.  RMSE or the sqrt(MSE) can be interpreted in y units
