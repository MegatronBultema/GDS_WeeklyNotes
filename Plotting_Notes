Code to get ours to function correctly. Pandas plotting is built on top of matplotlib, so we have to import it.
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

This just tells the IPython notebook to plot it inline (i.e. in the browser).
  %matplotlib inline

This will change the style that matplotlib uses (i.e. makes the plots look nicer than the default)
  plt.style.use('ggplot')
