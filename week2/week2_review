MOM
  pick a distribution
  compute relevant moment
  plug moments into:
      pmf: gives the probability of observing a given instance
      pdf: gives distribution plot of probability


MLE
  probability of the data given the distribution

MAP
  MLE using bayes


Central Limit Theorem
No matter what the underlying distribution is taking a large (<30) number of random samples
will generate a normal distirbution.

If the underlying distribution has a mean_pop and stddev_pop, the
sample will have a mean_s = mean_pop the stddev_s can be measured from the sample

SEM (standard error of the mean)
      SEM = (stddev_pop/sqrt(# samples)) BUT! we don't know the stddev_pop so we plug in our
            stddev_s and use this to get our confidence interval


1.96 - is the z value for 95% confidence level
