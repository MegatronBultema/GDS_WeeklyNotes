Review DSI
Week 0 and Week 1

SQL

* What is an RDBMS?
	

* What is a schema?
	summarizes the connections between the tables in a RDBMS
		possible to have multiple schema in a database

* What does SQL stand for and what is it?
	SQL Structured Query Language
	SEQUEL (Structured English Query Language)

* How do you access information stored in SQL databases?
	By selecting attributes to show from database via a query

* What are the two main parts of a SQL query?
	Select and from
* The following questions pertain to specific SQL commands:
    * How do you constrain the number of records returned by a query?
	WHERE - CONTENT
	  LIMIT - FOR NUMBER
    * How do you sort sort the order of records returned by a query?
	ORDER BY
    * How do you group rows together?
	GROUP BY 
    * How do you find specific rows in a table...
        * Before an aggregation?
		WHERE
        * After an aggregation?
		HAVING

* Name 3 types of joins and draw Venn diagram examples of them.
	OUTER - UNITON
	INNER - INTERSECTION
	LEFT (OR RIGHT)

* How might you improve the readability of a large, complicated query?  Think both
  regarding syntax and the formation of other tables.
	YOU CAN USE MORE WHITE SPACE
	YOU CAN USE TEMP TABLES


Probability

* What is Bayes rule?  What does it relate?
	Bayes rule
		P(Ahpy|Bdata) = P(Bdata|Ahyp)*P(Ahyp)
			      P(Bdata)

What is the probability of your hypothesis given the data taking your prior knowledge into account.

* What is combinatorics?
Combinatorics is the mathematics of ordering

* What are permutations?
There are  P(n,k)  unique ways to arrange  k  of  n  objects into a sequence (where order maters).

* How many ways can I arrange n unique objects?
	n!

* How many ways can I arrange k of n unique objects, where k < n?  What is this called?
	Called permutations. 
	fact(n)/fact(n-k)


* If order doesn't matter, how many ways can I pick of n objects? What is this called?
	Called combinations
	n!

* What is a random variable?
	outcome of a random variable, (an answer that may vary)

* How would you define the difference between discrete and continuous distributions?
	discrete - COUNTABLE - FLIP A COIN
	continuous - can take on all values 

* What distribution would you use to model the following cases:
    * What is the probability that the mean volume of 50 bottles is less than 500 ml?
	normal distribution
    * Deciding to go for a run or not.
	binomial - multiple success fail trials
 		bernuli - one trial for success or failure for a single instance 
    * Determining how many days pass before you finally decide to go for a run.
	geometric
    * Determining how likely it is that you go for 10 runs in a month.
	binomial
    * Calculating how much water falls into an open swimming pool during a rain storm.
	gamma * add gamma to list
          (poisson - is discrete, exponential- time until
    * Assuming you run at a 9 minute mile pace avg pace, determining how likely
      it is that you pass the 3 mile mark in a race in 25 minutes?
	exponential - within 25 min
	poisson - at exactly 25 min



Estimation-sampling

* What is the central limit theorem?
	No matter what the underlying distribution is taking a large (<30) number of random samples will generate a normal distribution.

* How would you go about implementing a bootstrap, and why would you do it?
	take a sample from your population, then randomly choose a value from your sample 
	with replacement until you have a BS sample the same length as your original 
	sample



Hypothesis testing

* What are the general steps of a hypothesis tests?  Make one up (something you'd test)
  and go through the steps.
	Want to determine if leaving at 7:15 takes the sam commute time as leaving my house at 6:45
	Ho - avg. commute(7:45) != avg. commute(6:45)
	Ha -  avg. commute(7:45) = avg. commute(6:45)

* What is a p value?
	the p value is the likelihood that I would get my data (mean, stddev) given the null hypothesis

* What is a type I error?
	type one error is rejecting the null hypothesis when you shouldn’t

* What is a type II error?
	type two error is failing to reject the null hypothesis when you should 


Power

* What are the four factors that influece power?
	n - size of samples
	k - number of samples
	f - degree of difference that you are testing for, effect size
	var - variance

* In Bayes rule, what are the posterior, the likelihood, and the prior distributions?
  How are they related?
	posterior is the probability that you come away with after taking the prior into account
	lieklihood the probability of getting your data given the hypothesis
	prior is the probability of the hypothesis being true
	

posterior = likelihood * prior (/normalizing factor) 
	normalizing factor - ….

Which A/B testing framework relies on significance testing? frequentistWhat about the other framework what does it use to guide decisions? bayesian, probabilities
