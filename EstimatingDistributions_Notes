MOM - distribution parameters
variance - tells us the spread
review distributions

exp. value per time - possion
  get lambda  (average)
  plot using scipy to plot

Maximum Likelihood - used more often for real data
  hypothesis with greatest


expectation maximization - generalize to multiple distriputions applied to one data set

choose a parametric approach and judge your theta on chi squared test
