MOM - distribution parameters
variance - tells us the spread
review distributions

exp. value per time - possion
  get lambda  (average)
  plot using scipy to plot

Maximum Likelihood - used more often for real data
  hypothesis with greatest


expectation maximization - generalize to multiple distriputions applied to one data set

choose a parametric approach and judge your theta on chi squared test


underlying distribution
  n=10 take 10 people and caluculate the mean
  repeat 1000 times
    doesn't really look normal

    n=200 take 200 people and caluculate the mean
    repeat 1000 times
      will look like a normal deistribution even if underlying distribution
          is very much not normal


    s = sample standard deviation
