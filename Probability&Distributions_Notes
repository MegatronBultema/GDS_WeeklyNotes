Random Variable
  an outcome
  within a specified sample space
  value is determined by a PDF
  X - values it can take
  x - value it actually took
  P(X=x)

Permutations - order matters
Combinations - order doesn't matter
always more permutations than combinations






Probability Notes

Cumulative distribution functions
  a function whose value is the probability that a corresponding continuous random variable has a value less than or equal to the argument of the function.

Probability mass function - discrete random variable
  In probability theory and statistics, a probability mass function (pmf) is a function that gives the probability that a discrete random variable is exactly equal to some value.

Probability density functions
  a function of a continuous random variable, whose integral across an interval gives the probability that the value of the variable lies within the same interval.
  PDF is associated with continuous rather than discrete random variables; the values of the PDF are not probabilities as such: a pdf must be integrated over an interval to yield a probability.

Expected value
  In more concrete terms, the expectation is what you would expect the outcome of an experiment to be on average. The expected value (or mean) of X, where X is a discrete random variable, is a weighted average of the possible values that X can take, each value being weighted according to the probability of that event occurring. So the expected value is the sum of: [(each of the possible outcomes) × (the probability of the outcome occurring)].

Variance
  The variance of a random variable tells us something about the spread of the possible values of the variable. For a discrete random variable X, the variance of X is written as Var(X).
    Var(X) = E[ (X – m)2 ]

Standard Deviation
  The standard deviation of X is the square root of Var(X).
  Why might the standard deviation be more useful than variance when talking about data?
      Because it is in the same units as your mean.

support = total possible values



Normal distribution
Bernoulli(p): probability that a single coin flip turns out to be heads
        PDF - p if x=1, 1-p if x=0

Binomial(n,p,k): (k)number of coin flips out of 100(n) that turn out to be heads where
                the probability(p) of head occuring is known
        PDF - choose(n,k) * p**k * (1-p) ** (n-k) for 0<= k <=n

Geometric(p): (k) number of trials until coin flip turns out to be heads
        PDF - p(1-p) ** (k-1) for k=1,2,...

Poisson(theta or lambda): (k) number of taxis passing a street corner in a given hour (on average pass 10/hour = theta)
        PDF - e**(-theata) * (theta**k)/k!

Exponential(theta or lambda): Time until taxi will pass street corner
        PDF - theta*e**(-theta*k) for k>=0 and theta>0

Uniform(a,b): Degrees between hour hand and minute hand
        PDF - 1/(b-a)

Normal or Gaussian(mu,stddev): normal distribution
        PDF - 1/(stddev * sqrt(2*pi)) * e**( k - (mu) ** 2/(2 * stddev ** 2)

Gamma:
The gamma distribution is widely used as a conjugate prior in Bayesian statistics. It is the conjugate prior for the precision (i.e. inverse of the variance) of a normal distribution. It is also the conjugate prior for the exponential distribution.

Examples:
What distribution would you use to model the following cases:
* What is the probability that the mean volume of 50 bottles is less than 500 ml?
	normal distribution
* Deciding to go for a run or not.
	binomial - multiple success fail trials
 	bernuli - one trial for success or failure for a single instance
* Determining how many days pass before you finally decide to go for a run.
	geometric
* Determining how likely it is that you go for 10 runs in a month.
	binomial
* Calculating how much water falls into an open swimming pool during a rain storm.
	gamma * add gamma to list
          (poisson - is discrete, exponential- time until)
* Assuming you run at a 9 minute mile pace avg pace, determining how likely it is that you pass the 3 mile mark in a race in 25 minutes?
	exponential - within 25 min
	poisson - at exactly 25 min
