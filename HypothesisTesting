1.  Determine the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis.
2.  Collect and summarize the data into a test statistic.
3.  Use the test statistic to determine the p-value.

4.  The result is statistically significant if the p-value is less than or
    equal to the level of significance.


Step 1. Determine the null and alternative hypotheses.

Null hypothesis: No difference in average fat lost in population for two methods. Population mean difference is zero.

Alternative hypothesis: There is a difference in average fat lost in population for two methods. Population mean difference is not zero.

Step 2. Collect and summarize data into a test statistic.
Diet Only:
sample mean = 5.9 kg
sample standard deviation = 4.1 kg sample size = n = 42
standard error = SEM1 = 4.1/ √42 = 0.633

Exercise Only:
sample mean = 4.1 kg
sample standard deviation = 3.7 kg sample size = n = 47
standard error = SEM2 = 3.7/ √47 = 0.540
measure of variability = [(0.633)**2 + (0.540)**2] = 0.83

The sample mean difference = 5.9 – 4.1 = 1.8 kg and the standard error of the difference (measure of variability) is 0.83.

So the test statistic: z = (1.8 – 0)/ 0.83 = 2.17

Now look up z-score in table:
  http://www.socscistatistics.com/pvalues/normaldistribution.aspx
table tells you the probability up till that z (0.985)
so to determine the p value of being significantly different take
1-z = 1-0.985 = 0.015
because this is a two tailed test we want our p-value to be
2*(1-z) = 0.03
because our alpha at 95% confidence is above the p-value we can reject the null hypothesis
   alpha =0.05 p =0.03
