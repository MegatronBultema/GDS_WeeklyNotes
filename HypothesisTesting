1.  Determine the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis.
2.  Collect and summarize the data into a test statistic.

ttest_1samp(a, popmean[, axis, nan_policy])	Calculates the T-test for the mean of ONE group of scores.
ttest_ind(a, b[, axis, equal_var, nan_policy])	Calculates the T-test for the means of two independent samples
ttest_ind_from_stats(mean1, std1, nobs1, ...)	T-test for means of two independent samples from descriptive statistics.
ttest_rel(a, b[, axis, nan_policy])	Calculates the T-test on TWO RELATED samples of scores, a and b.

z_test.py
    z score:
      compare two distributions: z = mean_samp1 - mean_samp2 -delta/SEM1
      normal aprox. of binomial: z = (h-0.5-mu)/sd ; h=sum of successes (or heads), mu = mean, sd = stddev, 0.5=p


3.  Use the test statistic to determine the p-value.
    Two sided p-value if Z > 0 ......p_value = 2 * (1-Phi(Z))
    else if Z is negative ...........p_value = 2 * (Phi(Z))

    One sided p-value if Z > 0 ......p_value = (1-Phi(Z))
    else if Z is negative ...........p_value = (Phi(Z))
    Phi is the standard notation for the CDF


      http://www.socscistatistics.com/pvalues/normaldistribution.aspx
      p_value = (2*(1 - st.norm.cdf(z))))

4.  The result is statistically significant if the p-value is less than or
    equal to the level of significance.


Step 1. Determine the null and alternative hypotheses.

Null hypothesis: No difference in average fat lost in population for two methods. Population mean difference is zero.

Alternative hypothesis: There is a difference in average fat lost in population for two methods. Population mean difference is not zero.

Step 2. Collect and summarize data into a test statistic.
Diet Only:
sample mean = 5.9 kg
sample standard deviation = 4.1 kg sample size = n = 42
standard error = SEM1 = 4.1/ √42 = 0.633

Exercise Only:
sample mean = 4.1 kg
sample standard deviation = 3.7 kg sample size = n = 47
standard error = SEM2 = 3.7/ √47 = 0.540
measure of variability = [(0.633)**2 + (0.540)**2] = 0.83

The sample mean difference = 5.9 – 4.1 = 1.8 kg and the standard error of the difference (measure of variability) is 0.83.

So the test statistic: z = (1.8 – 0)/ 0.83 = 2.17
                      z=sample mean difference - 0/measure of variability
scipy.stats.ttest_ind_from_stats(mean1, std1, nobs1, mean2, std2, nobs2, equal_var=True)
scipy.stats.ttest_ind_from_stats(5.9, 4.1, 42, 4.1, 3.7, 47, equal_var=False)



Now look up z-score in table:
  http://www.socscistatistics.com/pvalues/normaldistribution.aspx
table tells you the probability up till that z (0.985)
so to determine the p value of being significantly different take
1-z = 1-0.985 = 0.015
because this is a two tailed test we want our p-value to be
2*(1-z) = 0.03
  or 2*(1-scs.norm.cdf(2.17)) = 0.03

because our alpha at 95% confidence is above the p-value we can reject the null hypothesis
   alpha =0.05 p =0.03


What is the P(90<X<95)P(90<X<95) where mu = 80, sigma = 12?
a.cdf(95) - a.cdf(90) = 0.096

QUESTION: So we found that Z=2.0
What is the 2-sided p-value associated with that critical value?
z table = 0.9772
p_value 2*(1-0.9772)= 0.0456

  p_value = (2*(1 - st.norm.cdf(z))))


CONFIDENCE INTERVALS
 95% CI : mean +- 1.96(stddev/sqrt(# samples))

 scs.norm.ppf(1-0.05/2): z score at 1-alpha/2 (if alpha =0.05, 1-0.05/2 = 0.975)
                        this is allowing for 0.025 probability on either tail
                        so that the total probability density covered in the 95% CI
                        is 95% with 2.5% probability on either side.

              if one-tailes would be z=scs.norm.ppf(1-0.05)
